# E-Commerce Application using Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server - .NET 5

This project is a complete e-commerce application built using Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server, powered by .NET 5. It includes various features and components that make it a robust and scalable solution for building online stores.
Features
## Features

* **Admin Panel using Blazor Server** : The application provides an intuitive and feature-rich admin panel built using Blazor Server. This allows administrators to manage products, orders, customers, and other aspects of the e-commerce store efficiently.

* **.NET 5 API**: The project utilizes a backend API built with .NET 5, providing a solid foundation for handling business logic, data management, and integration with external services.

* **Consume .NET 5 API using Blazor WebAssembly**: The application demonstrates the seamless integration between Blazor WebAssembly and the .NET 5 API. This allows the client-side code to consume the API endpoints efficiently and retrieve data for dynamic rendering.

*  **Authentication & Authorization in Blazor Server and WebAssembly**: The project implements authentication and authorization mechanisms using Blazor Server and WebAssembly. This ensures secure user access and allows for personalized experiences, such as restricted content and user-specific settings.

* **Emails with Blazor**: Leveraging Blazor's capabilities, the application incorporates email functionality for sending notifications, order confirmations, and other communication with customers. This enhances the overall user experience and keeps users informed about their interactions with the store.

* **Radzen Components**: The project utilizes Radzen components, a powerful set of UI controls for Blazor, to enhance the user interface and provide a polished look and feel. These components facilitate the creation of responsive and visually appealing web pages.

* **Integrate Stripe Payments in Blazor WebAssembly**: The application integrates Stripe payment gateway, enabling seamless and secure online payments. Users can complete transactions using various payment methods, ensuring a smooth checkout experience.

* **Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection**: To maintain clean and scalable code, the project implements the repository pattern for data access and utilizes dependency injection for managing dependencies. This promotes separation of concerns and improves maintainability.
